## Notes:
### Directions:
- Using jQuery or vanilla JS you will display each 'USER' in a table.
- When the user selects a 'USER' in the table, it will display all of the 'POSTS' that were created by that 'USER'. 
- You have full freedom in how you accomplish the above objectives.
- You also have full freedom as far as design is concerned.
